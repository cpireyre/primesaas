A very simple program that takes a number as input and returns (it doesn't print, it returns; you check with `echo $?`) 1 or 0 depending on whether the number is prime.

I think the story was that a math-inclined friend needed some help testing out his implementation of the [Miller–Rabin primality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller–Rabin_primality_test) test for a hash table module he was designing.

I may also have been thinking of deploying this as a lambda somewhere or whatever for fun but never got around to it.
